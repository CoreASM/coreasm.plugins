Plugins for - The CoreASM Modeling Framework
==============================

This repository contributes plugins for the CoreASM open source project that 
focuses on offering a lean executable ASM (Abstract State Machines) language,
in combination with a supporting tool environment for high-level design,
experimental validation and formal verification (where appropriate) of abstract system models.

In order to avoid redundancy, we share the [wiki](https://github.com/CoreASM/coreasm.core/wiki) of the main CoreASM repository.
